Structured autonomous-loop entries start below this header. The Phase 1 smoke test is intentionally not logged as an iteration.

### iter_001 — stability_selection_genes
- type: ALGO
- idea_id: stability_selection_genes
- hypothesis: Replacing univariate Cox ranking with LASSO-Cox stability selection (100 half-subsamples, ≥60% frequency threshold) will produce a more robust gene feature pool, improving both val_ci and val_rmst_diff.
- changed_files: xgb_arena/train.py

**Red-line audit (pre-edit):**
- Gene selection uses `train_df` only; `valid_df` is not consulted during stability selection. ✓
- `rank_genes_univariate` is called inside `run()` using `train_df` (train CSV). The new `stability_selection_genes` replaces this call with identical scoping. ✓
- No path that touches `affyfRMATest.csv` is added or implied. ✓
- `valid_df` continues to be used only for final evaluation (`evaluate_on_valid`). ✓
- IPTW, scalers, and encoders remain fitted on boot training rows only (unchanged). ✓
- Censored patients are not dropped (unchanged). ✓
- Treatment recommendation logic (counterfactual risk comparison) is unchanged. ✓

*Result to be filled in after run.*
